# D601-AllTasks-Building-an-Interactive-Data-Dashboard
### Overview

### Interactive Data Dashboard â€“ Hospital Readmission Analysis (Tableau)
-	Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau with four visualizations (bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, pie chart) and two key metrics (average charges, length of stay) to support executive decision-making.
-	Integrated interactive filters (state, complication risk) to allow dynamic data exploration; ensured accessibility with a colorblind-friendly palette and clear annotations.
-	Communicated insights on patient readmissions, service utilization, and hospital costs, driving actionable recommendations for cost reduction and service optimization.
### Data Storytelling & Audience Engagement
-	Developed and delivered a simulated presentation tailored for technical (analysts) and non-technical (executives) audiences, adapting complex analytics into clear, actionable messages.
-	Applied audience analysis to refine messaging, emphasizing actionable insights like reducing high-risk patient costs and optimizing common services (e.g., blood work).
-	Implemented best practices in visual storytelling to engage varied stakeholders, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and decision-driven insights.
