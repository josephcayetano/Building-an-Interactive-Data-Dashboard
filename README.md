# Building an Interactive Data Dashboard
### Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze hospital readmissions and present actionable insights. It emphasizes both technical dashboard development and effective data storytelling to engage stakeholders and support decision-making.

### Interactive Data Dashboard – Hospital Readmission Analysis (Tableau)
-	Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau with four visualizations (bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, pie chart) and two key metrics (average charges, length of stay) to support executive decision-making.
-	Integrated interactive filters (state, complication risk) to allow dynamic data exploration; ensured accessibility with a colorblind-friendly palette and clear annotations.
-	Communicated insights on patient readmissions, service utilization, and hospital costs, driving actionable recommendations for cost reduction and service optimization.
### Data Storytelling & Audience Engagement
-	Developed and delivered a simulated presentation tailored for technical (analysts) and non-technical (executives) audiences, adapting complex analytics into clear, actionable messages.
-	Applied audience analysis to refine messaging, emphasizing actionable insights like reducing high-risk patient costs and optimizing common services (e.g., blood work).
-	Implemented best practices in visual storytelling to engage varied stakeholders, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and decision-driven insights.
