# Building an Interactive Data Dashboard
### Overview
This project created an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore hospital readmissions and share insights that support better decisions. It focused on both building the dashboard and clearly explaining the data to different audiences.

### Interactive Data Dashboard â€“ Hospital Readmission Analysis (Tableau)
-	Built a Tableau dashboard with bar, line, scatter, and pie charts, plus key metrics like average charges and length of stay
-	Added filters (e.g., state, risk level) so users could explore the data easily; used accessible colors and clear labels
-	Shared insights on readmissions, hospital services, and costs to recommend ways to reduce expenses and improve care
### Data Storytelling & Audience Engagement
-	Gave a mock presentation for both technical and non-technical audiences, explaining results in a simple and useful way
-	Focused the message on key takeaways, like lowering high-risk patient costs and improving commonly used services
-	Used visual storytelling best practices to keep the dashboard clear, accessible, and focused on helping decision-makers
